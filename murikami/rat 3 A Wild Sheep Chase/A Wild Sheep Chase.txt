A Wild Sheep Chase by Haruki Murakami
Read by Rupert Degas
Naxos, 8 CDs, 9:35

A Wild Sheep Chase is one of Murakami's most fantastical novels. An advertising executive, infatuated with a girl who possesses teh most perfect ears, is sent on a search for the sheep with a star on its back. This catapults him into a weird adventure to find the sheep in the wilds of Hookaido, Japan's northern island. There are strange stories, strange encounters. A Wild Sheep Chase is an early murakami work, but its remarkable and individual voice makes it one of the most compelling - and funny - of his books.
